Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

   *** You can stay in charge of changes that are made remotely... only allowing those in that you choose. 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you use one instead of another?

    *** Forks use GitHub servers to create an editable copy of another user's repository into your account.  it provides reference 
    *** Clones create local copies of repositories, either remote to local or local to local. 
    *** branches creates a divergence in a single repository as you take different paths down development of a single repository's code. 

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

    *** You have an idea what the shore side is looking at. 

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    *** Detailed named versions / allow only one person to work on a file at a time. 

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?
